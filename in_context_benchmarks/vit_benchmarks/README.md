This is a collection of mini-applications ("mini-benchmarks") within the context 
of the ALCF-4 AI/ML benchmark applications. We have written these as 
representative of the critical operations performed by the applications. This
effort keeps the order of execution of operations as close to the full 
application as possible. 

### Content of the directory
Here we give a brief description of each benchmark.


#### Holistic Ulysses: 
- Benchmarks the entire Ulysses as a whole including the exact computation.
- backward implementation (TBD)
- DP + Zero (TBD)

#### Holistic Ulysses: 
- Benchmarks only the communication of Ulysses + DP + Zero
- Elaborate Timing (TBD)
